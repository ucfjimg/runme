This is just a short demo program showing how to run a child process
for grading or judging in a competitive programming contest.

The child program can be run with no input, or handed a file to
read from stdin. It will also be run with a timeout of 2 seconds.

The input will be collected via a pipe from the child's stdout,
and could then be compared against test case output.

wait(2) is used to determine if the child timed out, crashed
(seg fault or bus error), or exited successfully.

runme.c is the wraper to run the child; all other c files are 
short programs to test the various functions. test.sh will compile
and run everything.
